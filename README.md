# function hub (wip)

## protocol

each function has<br>
* one development file (ipynb, py)<br>
* one final code file (ipynb, py)<br>
* one corresponding yaml file<br>
* one test file (ipynb)<br>
    - preferrably ipynb that can be run under CI<br>
    - potentially could be a nuclio/mlrun function so that some areas are dev, others are test
    (I think this is a good feature because ...)
* one readme/tutorial (ipynb)

## details

To follow are ...

### code 

#### format style of function
#### commenting
#### documentation

### yaml

#### autogen

### test

the development of function should be done...
