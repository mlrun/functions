# serving models

Model Serving provides a solution to host machine learning / deep learning (ML/DL) models as REST endpoints that are updated automatically, enabling data science teams to own the end-to-end lifecycle of a real-time machine learning model from training to production.

**`model_server.ipynb`** deploy any classifier model that has been pickled (cloudpickle).
