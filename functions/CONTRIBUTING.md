:+1: :tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to read the guidelines and for considering contributing! :tada: :+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the functions' repository and its packages. These are mostly 
guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## What Should I Know Before I Start?
### Concepts

#### 1) Functions
All the executions in MLRun are based on Serverless Functions, the functions allow specifying code and 
all the operational aspects (image, required packages, cpu/mem/gpu resources, storage, environment, etc.), the 
different function runtimes take care of automatically transforming the code and spec to fully managed and elastic 
services over Kubernetes which save significant operational overhead, address scalability and reduce infrastructure costs.

MLRun supports batch functions (based on Kubernetes jobs, Spark, Dask, Horovod, etc.) or Real-time functions for 
serving, APIs, and stream processing (based on the high-performance Nuclio engine).

[Function runtimes](https://docs.mlrun.org/en/latest/runtimes/functions.html#function-runtimes) <br>
[Nuclio docs](https://nuclio.io/docs/latest/) <br>

#### 2) function.yaml
A structure of configuration resembles the Kubernetes resource definitions, and includes the 
apiVersion, kind, metadata, spec, and status sections. This file is the result of running:
```python
import mlrun
fn = mlrun.code_to_function(...)
fn.export()
```

[Deploying functions](https://nuclio.io/docs/latest/tasks/deploying-functions/) <br>

#### 3) Marketplace
The function marketplace is a user-friendly representation of the `mlrun/functions` repository. The 
main purpose of the Function Marketplace is to provide a simple (yet interactive) and explorable interface for users to
find, filter and discover MLRun functions. It is partially inspired by the helm’s ArtifactHub.

#### 4) item.yaml
A structure of configuration that enables:
1) Generating a `function.yaml` without introducing any configuration in the example notebook
1) Allows the function to be listed on the marketplace 


### Function directory structure
This is a suggested function structure, deviating from this structure template will cause issues with marketplace 
rendering.
```text
<FUNCTION_NAME>
      |
      |__ <FUNCTION_NAME>.py (Containing the implementation code of FUNCTION_NAME)
      |
      |__ <FUNCTION_NAME>.ipynb (Containing an example for running and deploying the FUNCTION_NAME)
      |
      |__ item.yaml (Containing the spec for generating function.yaml and being listed on the marketplace)
      |
      |__ function.yaml (Containing the spec for deploying the function)
      |
      |__ test_<FUNCTION_NAME>.py (optional)
      |
      |__ test_<FUNCTION_NAME>.ipynb (optional)
```

### item.yaml anatomy

## Installation Guide
It is highly advised using the functions package in a dedicated environment, since Pipenv is used as part of the testing routine, 
conda can be used instead.

1) Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (or any other environment manager)
1) Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/mlrun/functions.git`
1) cd to the functions directory `cd functions`
1) Create a new environment `conda install -n functions python=3.8`
1) Activate the environment `source activate functions`
1) Install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Creating A New Function
See [command line utility > section 6](#command-line-utility)  
See [function directory structure](#function-directory-structure)  
See [testing functions](#testing-functions)

## Updating An Existing Function
1) Fork the `mlrun/functions` [repository](https://github.com/mlrun/functions)
1) Open a branch with a name describing the function that is being changed, and what was changed  

    \* Make sure to update the version of the function in the `item.yaml`<br>
    \* If any business logic changed, make to update the `function.yaml` by running the 
`python function.py item-to-function [OPTIONS]` command <br>
1) Submit a PR


## Testing Functions
(WORK IN PROGRESS)
### 1) item.yaml validation
### 2) function.yaml validation
### 3) Python unittests
### 4) Testing example notebooks
