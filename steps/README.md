# Steps

Custom steps are individual execution units that are executed as part of a graph. 
Each step has its own execution context and can run with different settings.
To learn how to build and use custom steps, see: [writing-custom-steps](https://docs.mlrun.org/en/stable/serving/writing-custom-steps.html).
As public contributions, we ask that all contributors follow the project’s guidelines and conventions (please chip in).
